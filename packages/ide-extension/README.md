# Knowledge Hub extension
Knowledge Hub is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline SAP developers' search for information by aggregating training and documentation resources (tutorials, blogs, and more) in the user's integrated development environment (IDE). 

SAP provides developers with a variety of different learning resources in order to meet the needs of users with different experience levels. Using a traditional search engine, it can sometimes be challenging to perform a search across all of SAP's properties due to the different search result rankings of these various sites. Knowledge Hub simplifies this research process by allowing users to perform focused searches across SAP-owned properties. At this time, resources from the SAP Developer Tutorials site and blogs on the SAP Community are available. Clicking on a search result will navigate users directly to the resource in the browser. 

## Accessing Knowledge Hub
Once installed into your IDE, Knowledge Hub can be accessed using the following procedure:
```
1. Open the Command Palette: CMD/CTRL + Shift + P
2. Type the command: Knowledge Hub: Open Knowledge Hub
3. Press Enter
```
## Getting support

## Contributing to this extension
This project is intended to bring together both the external and internal SAP development communities to build and improve on an extension that provides streamlined access to a wide variety of development resources. Our goal is help our users understand what is possible with their SAP projects and then help them implement it. If you have ideas on how we can make this extension better, we would love to collaborate with you. You can contribute by creating [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SAP/knowledge-hub-extension/issues) for feature requests, framework improvements, and bug reports.
